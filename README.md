# I'm Learning Reactive Programming

My name is [Mauricio](http://twitter.com/omauriciosoares), and by the day this repository was created, I was a crap reactive programming developer!

Yeah, that's sad, but it's true... Nobody was born knowing everything, and the idea of this repo is to share everything I learn as I'm developing RP code...

I'll use the [Javascript ReactiveX library](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) for this study. Javascript because is my strongest programming language, and [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) because it seems to be the most popular RP library until now.

In the `examples` dir you'll find all the code I'm writting about RP, and for beginner RP developers, I'll keep everything as documented and well explained as I can.

Also I'll try to link the [documentation](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc) as much as possible, as well as the [rxmarbles](http://rxmarbles.com) website (which will help us to understand a lot of methods in RP).

## So, what the heck is Reactive Programming?

I'll try to explain here what I think reactive programming is, as I'm learning it...

In short words, reactive programming is a way of programming using streams...

A stream may be defined as an Array of "things", and these things can be DOM events, ajax calls, and even other streams!

Yeah, that's it for now... I'll improve this. :)
