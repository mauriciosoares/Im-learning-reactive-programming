# I'm Learning Reactive Programming

My name is Mauricio, and by the day this repository was created, I was a crap reactive programming developer!

Yeah, that's sad, but it's true... Nobody was born knowing everything, and the idea of this repo is to share everything I learn as I'm developing RP code...

In the `examples` dir you'll find all the code I'm writting about RP, and for beginner RP developers, I'll keep everything as documented and well explained as I can.

Also I'll try to link the [documentation](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc) as much as possible, as well as the [rxmarbles](http://rxmarbles.com) website (which will help us to understand a lot of methods in RP).
